# Peachy Tweaks for Mastodon  🐘🍋🍑

## Collection of CSS tweaks initally made for my personal instance [nileane.fr](https://nileane.fr)

Tweaks so far include :
- Set a custom accent color 
- Hide several redundant UI elements
- Trim down the UI for logged-out visitors
- Tweaks to profile fields (no 'Joined' field, less obnoxious verified fields)
- Little fancy things here and there (ie. backdrop blur on headers)
- The bits of CSS that support my custom About page ([nileane.fr/about](https://nileane.fr/about))


There are currently 2 variants: **Lemon** and **Peach**.  
The only differences between the two variants are the values for the accent colors.
